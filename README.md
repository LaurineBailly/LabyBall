# TP3
## LabyBall

---

A ball that browses in a labyrinth thanks to the phone accelerometer. The user has to make it roll from a point A to a point B in order to win the game. The game has several levels.
- **TP3.1:** The ball browses in function of the phone accelerometer and bounces when it meets hurdles (screen edges or bricks). The labyrinth is made of 3 bricks only added in the program, which do not touch each other.  
- **TP3.2:** The ball does not browse on the labyrinth bricks even if they touch each other : all the labyrinth bricks are hurdles.  
- **TP3.3:** The labyrinth is drawn thanks to a file input.   
- **TP3.4:** The user has to make the ball browse from a point A to a point B. 
- **TP3.5:** The user is advertised when winning the game and another labyrinth is loaded.
